# company-system-backend
## Introduction:
- Welcome to the company system project! This project is designed to help an admin manage employees and departments within a company.
- The system allows the admin to perform various tasks related to employee and department management, such as creating, editing, deleting, and getting one employee, as well as assigning employees to departments. The admin can also create, update, delete, and get departments, and view all employees belonging to a specific department.
- To ensure that only authorized users can access the system, we have implemented Spring Security. This means that all URLs in the application are secured and can only be accessed by an authenticated admin.

- The project is built using Spring Boot, which provides a powerful platform for building web applications. We are using MySQL as the database to store employee and department information

## Features:
