## Introduction:
- Welcome to the company system project! This project is designed to help an admin manage employees and departments within a company.
- The system allows the admin to perform various tasks related to employee and department management, such as creating, editing, deleting, and getting one employee, as well as assigning employees to departments. The admin can also create, update, delete, and get departments, and view all employees belonging to a specific department.
- To ensure that only authorized users can access the system, we have implemented Spring Security. This means that all URLs in the application are secured and can only be accessed by an authenticated admin.

- The project is built using Spring Boot, which provides a powerful platform for building web applications. We are using MySQL as the database to store employee and department information

## Features: 
1. Employee management: The system allows the admin to create, edit, delete, and get one employee. The admin can view all employees in the system or search for a specific employee by name or department. 
2. Department management: The admin can create, update, delete, and get departments in the system. The admin can also view all employees belonging to a specific department.
3. Employee-Department relationship: The admin can assign an employee to a department, and view all employees belonging to a specific department.
4. URL security: All URLs in the application are secured and can only be accessed by an authenticated admin. This is achieved using Spring Security, which restricts access to certain features and ensures that only authorized users can access the system.
5. Spring Boot: The project is built using Spring Boot, which provides a powerful platform for building web applications. This allows us to easily manage dependencies, configure the application, and launch the application.
6. MySQL: The system uses MySQL as the database to store employee and department information. This provides a reliable and scalable solution for managing data.

## Technologies:
1. Spring Boot: Spring Boot is a powerful framework that provides a platform for building web applications. It simplifies the process of creating and deploying applications by providing a pre-configured environment for developers.
2. MySQL: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is used to store employee and department information in the system.
